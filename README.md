# Architecture office website 

This is a quick concept website for an architectural office, built with React. TypeScript is used to ensure type-safety.
This project is a test of my typescript, react and fullstack skills. It connects to the separate archiwebsite-backend
repository, which accesses a MongoDB database.

## Design
I wanted the UI to be interactive and clean. I therefore ensured that editting and adding was simple and without the need to use modals or by taking the user away from the main page.

## Tools
This is a Next.js project
